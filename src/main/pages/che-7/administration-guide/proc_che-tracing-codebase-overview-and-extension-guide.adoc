== Procedure

The core of tracing implementation for Che is placed at `che-core-tracing-core` and `che-core-tracing-web` modules.

The Che API has the following ways to provide tracing spans:
Currently, all HTTP requests to API will have its own trace. This is done by TracingFilter from https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-web-servlet-filter, bound for the whole server application.
Adding @Traced annotation to methods will cause the TracingInterceptor to add tracing spans for them.

Tags

Spans may contain some standard tags, such as operation name, span origin, error as well as there may be others, that may help users with querying and filtering them.
Like workspace related operations (like start or stop workspace) have additional tags such as userId, workspaceId, stackId.
Spans created by TracingFilter would also have an HTTP status code tag.

Declaring tags in a traced method is done statically, by setting fields from `TracingTags` class:

`TracingTags.WORKSPACE_ID.set(workspace.getId());`

TracingTags is a class where all commonly used tags are declared, as respective AnnotationAware Tag implementations.
